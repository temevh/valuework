# valuemap

Looking for a work is a job in itself, but it should not be.

Valuemap matches job seekers with companies based on shared values, believes and needs. Employees of a company can anonymously answer questions regarding the company, which are saved and then used to recommend and rank companies to people looking for a company where they actually fit in.

Valuemap aims to be a minimalistic, easy and quick to use service, that can be used without creating profiles or subscribing to spammy newsletters.

After answering a randomized selection of questions the job seeker is presented with companies, ranked by the how much their values match. Valuemap displays gives an easily digestable summary of the company with recent trends related to the company, with the help of deep learning and large language models.

Using valuemap offers benefits for all parties involved. Job seekers find a job which they enjoy, thus leading to a happier work environment and less sick leaves.
